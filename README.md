# Clothing_Wear_Customer_Behaviour_Analysis
Data analytics project of customer trends in a clothing store and recommendations for identified trends, using Python, SQL and Power BI.

Data Analytics Project

Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to insights presentation. It highlights skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and storytelling with Gamma presentations. The goal is to showcase the ability to handle end‑to‑end analytics tasks: cleaning, exploring, querying, visualizing, and communicating results.

Dataset
--The dataset is loaded in Python (CSV/Excel format).
--It contains information relevant to business analysis (e.g., sales, customers, or operations).
--Size: medium (~10k–100k rows).
--Columns include both numerical and categorical features.

Tools & Technologies
--Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
--PostgreSQL / SQL Server – for running SQL queries and relational data analysis.
--Power BI – for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.
--Gamma – for creating a professional presentation (PPT) summarizing findings.

Steps
--Load Dataset – Import data into Python for initial inspection.
--Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends, distributions, and correlations.
--Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
--SQL Queries – Run advanced queries in PostgreSQL/SQL Server to validate and enrich insights.
--Dashboard Creation – Build a Power BI dashboard with KPIs, charts, and filters.
--Report Writing – Summarize findings in a structured report.
--Presentation – Create a Gamma PPT to communicate results clearly to stakeholders.

Dashboard
Built in Power BI.
Includes:
--Key performance indicators (KPIs).
--Trend analysis (time series).
--Segmentation by categories (e.g., region, product).
--Interactive filters for deeper exploration.

Results
--Clean dataset ready for analysis.
--Insights into patterns, anomalies, and business drivers.
--SQL queries validated findings with relational logic.
--Power BI dashboard provides interactive exploration.
--Final report and Gamma PPT communicate results in a recruiter‑friendly format.
